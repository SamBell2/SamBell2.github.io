I got the idea in my Computer Science lessons at school, where I learnt how a CPU works and realised that it isn't actually as complex as I thought. I then started to make parts of it to test in Minecraft, before finding Ben Eater's similar project and using that as a guide to making the basic parts of the computer. Specs 6 - 48 Hz variable clock speed 1 core 64kB RAM 16 registers; r0 is a zero register 8-bit maths Von Neumann architecture My Aim I want to make an 8-bit CPU with 16 instructions. It will be fully Turing-complete. It will be able to do maths, store data, jump and branch to other parts of a program, and input and output to other devices. The instruction set I want to implement are adding, subtracting, NORing, right shifting, loading from RAM, storing to RAM, loading from a port, storing to a port, loading immediate values, adding immediate values, jumping around the program, branching to other parts of a program depending on a condition, and halting. How I'm Building It I am making it module by module, first breadboarding it to test it and make sure it works, then soldering it down to a solderable breadboard . So far, I have fully tested the clock module and have mostly soldered it down. I have also tested most of the ALU but had to stop because I ran out of wires! I am soldering the components to the top of the board so you can see them easily and the wires to the bottom of the board, just because I think it looks neater. The back of my CPU with all the wires Challenges I am learning a lot about the internal mechanisms of how computers actually work at the most detailed level, as well as soldering skills, PCB design, and electronic principles such as why pull-up/down resistors are actually necessary.","title":"CPU"},{"location":"electronics/cpu/#cpu","text":"An image of my CPU so far","title":"CPU"},{"location":"electronics/cpu/#overview","text":"This is my current project, it is an 8-bit CPU built out of individual ICs (Integrated Circuits).

It is a homemade safe with a 4-bit code to unlock the electromagnet. I sawed the MDF sheets and screwed them together, before adding an electromagnet inside and some metal washers on the door. On top are the electronics, which consist of a 4.5V battery pack, a DIP (Dual Inline Package) switch, 4 AND gates, 6 NOT gates, a transistor, a relay and a 12V battery. A schematic diagram of how the electronics work My Aim I wanted to make a safe with a door that locked, and you could only open it if you know the code. I mostly achieved that goal, as there is some resistance to the door when it is locked, but none when unlocked. However, it isn't a very safe safe as the electromagnet isn't very strong so you can just pull the door open, or you could just unplug the batteries. How it works There are 4 switches, each of which is on or off, The 1st, 3rd and 4th switches are inverted, The outputs of the inverters and the 2nd switch are ANDed together. This means that the output of this is only on if the 1st input is off, the 2nd input is on, and the 3rd and 4th inputs are off. The output of this switches a transistor to increase current, The output of the transistor switches a relay to increase voltage, The relay switches the electromagnet, The electromagnet pulls of washers glued to the inside of the door to close it Challenges It was my first large DIY project so I had to learn to use a saw and a drill safely, as well as the electronics. The main problem I had with the electronics was that I had forgotten pull-down resistors, so the inputs were floating (no definite value) when the switches were off. I eventually Googled the problem and put the resistors in and it worked, but I didn't realise why until I started making my CPU . What I would change If I built it again now, I would change a few things: I would use a solenoid pushing into a hole instead of an electromagnet. I would use a PCB to stop people unplugging wires. I would place all of the electronics inside the safe, with only the switches on top. I would use more switches, e.g. a 10-bit code","title":"Safe"},{"location":"electronics/safe/#safe","text":"My finished safe","title":"Safe"},{"location":"electronics/safe/#overview","text":"This is my first large electronics project: I made it when I was 9!

It generates all legal moves and evaluates them, giving them points. It then plays the highest-ranking move. I have given it a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) frontend so it can interact with other chess apps. For example, I have given it a Lichess account ( SamFish96 ) and occasionally it is online.You can see the source code on GitHub . Inspiration I've been interested in complex decision making programs for a while, and a chess bot was a suitably complex but not overwhelming introduction to them. How it works It uses an 8x8 array of pieces or empty squares to represent the board. Whenever the chess app tells it that a move has been made, it simulates the move on its own board. When it needs to move one of its pieces, it looks at all of the possible moves that it can make, discards any that put it in check, then evaluates all of them. If it has time, it looks at the next turn or two as well. It then picks the move it thinks is best and plays it. Key Features Generates almost all possible moves. Uses syzygy tablebases for the endgame to ensure perfect moves. Detects checks, checkmates, stalemates and threefold repetition. Automatic detailed logging to see the bot's logic. Interacts with the Lichess bot API to play online.","title":"Chess Bot"},{"location":"programming/chess_bot/#chess-bot","text":"A Lichess.org game where my bot won","title":"Chess Bot"},{"location":"programming/chess_bot/#overview","text":"I created a Java program that can play chess.
