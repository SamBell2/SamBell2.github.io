I love computer science and everything related to digital making, and have since I learnt the basics of Python when I was 8. Since then, it has become my main hobby and the direction I want my career to go in. In 2020, I got my first Raspberry Pi and learnt about electronics. Recently I realised that digital making and robotics combine both of my main interests, and those are what I'm focussing on now. My Favourite Projects Project Description Link Chess Bot I created a fully-functional lookahead evaluation chess bot View Project CPU A simple 8-bit CPU that I am currently making View Project QR Code Generator I made a v5 QR code generator in python View Project WER 2025 An international robotics competition where I came 1st in the UK in my age category More information My Skills Technical Skills Programming : Python, Java, HTML/CSS Electronics : Soldering, PCB Design (KiCad) Tools : Git, Raspberry Pi, CAD (Autodesk Inventor & OpenSCAD) Soft Skills Problem Solving Communication Resilience Recent Achievements British champion in an international robotics competition Finalist in Cyber Switchup 2023 Predicted Grade 9 in GCSE Computer Science Get in Touch Email: samgbell2011@icloud.com Phone: 07468779147 Portfolio: https://sambell2.github.io View My Full Portfolio \u279c","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#sam-bell","text":"","title":"Sam Bell"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"I am a 14 year old electronics and programming enthusiast.

I got the idea in my Computer Science lessons at school, where I learnt how a CPU works and realised that it isn't actually as complex as I thought. I then started to make parts of it to test in Minecraft, before finding Ben Eater's similar project and using that as a guide to making the basic parts of the computer. Specs 6 - 48 Hz variable clock speed 1 core 64kB RAM 16 registers; r0 is a zero register 8-bit maths Von Neumann architecture My Aim I want to make an 8-bit CPU with 16 instructions. It will be fully Turing-complete. It will be able to do maths, store data, jump and branch to other parts of a program, and input and output to other devices. The instruction set I want to implement are adding, subtracting, NORing, right shifting, loading from RAM, storing to RAM, loading from a port, storing to a port, loading immediate values, adding immediate values, jumping around the program, branching to other parts of a program depending on a condition, and halting. How I'm Building It I am making it module by module, first breadboarding it to test it and make sure it works, then soldering it down to a solderable breadboard . So far, I have fully tested the clock module and have mostly soldered it down. I have also tested most of the ALU but had to stop because I ran out of wires! I am soldering the components to the top of the board so you can see them easily and the wires to the bottom of the board, just because I think it looks neater. Challenges I am learning a lot about the internal mechanisms of how computers actually work at the most detailed level, as well as soldering skills, PCB design, and electronic principles such as why pull-up/down resistors are actually necessary.","title":"CPU"},{"location":"electronics/cpu/#cpu","text":"This is my current project, it is an 8-bit CPU built out of individual ICs (Integrated Circuits).
