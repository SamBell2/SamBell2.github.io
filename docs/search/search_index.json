I love computer science and everything related to digital making, and have since I learnt the basics of Python when I was 8. Since then, it has become my main hobby and the direction I want my career to go in. In 2020, I got my first Raspberry Pi and learnt about electronics. Recently I realised that digital making and robotics combine both of my main interests, and those are what I'm focussing on now. My Favourite Projects Project Description Link Chess Bot I created a fully-functional lookahead evaluation chess bot View Project CPU A simple 8-bit CPU that I am currently making View Project WER 2025 An international robotics competition where I came 1st in the UK in my age category More information My Skills Technical Skills Programming : Python, Java, HTML/CSS Electronics : Soldering, PCB Design (KiCad) Tools : Git, Raspberry Pi, CAD (Autodesk Inventor & OpenSCAD) Soft Skills Problem Solving Communication Resilience Recent Achievements 4th place in an international robotics competition Finalist in Cyber Switchup 2023 Get in Touch Email: samgbell2011@icloud.com Phone: 07468779147 Portfolio: https://sambell2.github.io View My Full Portfolio \u279c","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#sam-bell","text":"","title":"Sam Bell"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"I am a 14 year old electronics and programming enthusiast.
