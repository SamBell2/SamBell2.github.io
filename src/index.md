## About Me
I am a 14 year old electronics and programming enthusiast. I love computer science and everything related to digital making, and have since I learnt the basics of Python when I was 8. Since then, it has become my main hobby and the direction I want my career to go in. In 2020, I got my first Raspberry Pi and learnt about electronics. Recently I realised that digital making and robotics combine both of my main interests, and those are what I'm focusing on now. I have made loads (82 that I still have records of!) of projects of varying degrees of difficulty. This portfolio contains the ones that I am most proud of.

## My Skills

### **Technical Skills**
- **Programming**: I know how to program in many languages (e.g. C, HTML/CSS, and Go, to name a few), but my strongest are Python and Java.
- **Electronics**: Soldering, PCB Design (KiCad), and simply being able to work out how stuff should work.
- **Tools**: Git, Raspberry Pi, CAD (Autodesk Inventor & OpenSCAD)
- **Systems**: I understand how systems like Linux work due to me constantly changing, fixing and improving them on my own computer.

### **Soft Skills**
- **Problem Solving** - I have come across many challenges over my 5 years of making, and seeing as my family and friends aren't interested in coding or making, I have to solve everything myself using the internet, magazines and books. This has made me pretty good at problem solving.
- **Curiosity** - I have always wanted to know how things work, and I usually find this out by making it (e.g. my [QR code generator](programming/qr_code_generator.md))
- **Resilience** - I just refuse to give up, even if a problem takes me years to solve! I started many of my projects (such as the [Light Fantastic](digital_making/light_fantastic.md)) when I was younger and didn't have enough knowledge, skills or experience, but I kept coming back to them until I managed to finish them.
