## About Me
I am a 14 year old electronics and programming enthusiast. I love computer science and everything related to digital making, and have since I learnt the basics of Python when I was 8. Since then, it has become my main hobby and the direction I want my career to go in. In 2020, I got my first Raspberry Pi and learnt about electronics. Recently I realised that digital making and robotics combine both of my main interests, and those are what I'm focussing on now.
